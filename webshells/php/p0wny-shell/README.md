# p0wny@shell:~# -- Single-file PHP Shell

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-Discord-8c9eff?logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff)](https://discord.gg/P77sWhuSs4)

p0wny@shell:~# is a very basic, single-file, PHP shell. It can be used to quickly execute commands on a server when pentesting a PHP application. Use it with caution: this script represents a security risk for the server.

**Features:**

* Command history (using arrow keys `‚Üë` `‚Üì`)
* Auto-completion of command and file names (using `Tab` key)
* Navigate on the remote file-system (using `cd` command)
* Upload a file to the server (using `upload <destination_file_name>` command)
* Download a file from the server (using `download <file_name>` command)

**WARNING:** THIS SCRIPT IS A SECURITY HOLE. **DO NOT** UPLOAD IT ON A SERVER UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

**Demo with Docker:**

        docker build -t p0wny .
        docker run -it -p 8080:80 -d p0wny
        # open with your browser http://127.0.0.1:8080/shell.php

### Bugs

* Your operating system¬†/ Linux distribution (and its version)
* The PHP version you are using (example: `PHP-FPM 8.1`, `Apache mod_php 7.4`,...)
* The Web server you are using and its version (example: `Nginx 1.23`, `Apache 2.4.55`,...)

* etc.


### Pull requests

Please consider [filing a bug](https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell/issues) before starting to work on a new feature; it will allow us to discuss the best way to do it. It is obviously unnecessary if you just want to fix a typo or small errors in the code.
