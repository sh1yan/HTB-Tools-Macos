# Tool Overview
SharpSCCM is a post-exploitation tool designed to leverage Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (a.k.a. ConfigMgr, formerly SCCM) for lateral movement and credential gathering without requiring access to the SCCM administration console GUI. 

SharpSCCM was initially created to execute user hunting and lateral movement functions ported from PowerSCCM (by @harmj0y, @jaredcatkinson, @enigma0x3, and @mattifestation) and now contains additional functionality to gather credentials and abuse newly discovered attack primitives for coercing NTLM authentication in SCCM sites where automatic site-wide client push installation is enabled.

Please [visit the wiki](https://github.com/Mayyhem/SharpSCCM/wiki) for documentation detailing how to build and use SharpSCCM, supporter, contributors, and defensive recommendations.
