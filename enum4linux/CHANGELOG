2012-11-30 Enum4linux v0.8.9

* -d option decodes some of the acb_info field including
  if account is disabled, password expired, acct locked.

2011-06-16 Enum4linux v0.8.8

* Bug fix: -w option should now work better.  Allows 
  domain crenedials to be used:
  -w domain -u user -p pass ...

2011-02-21 Enum4linux v0.8.7

* Bug fix: Now handles apostrophe in group names and 
  other places.  Thanks to Emeric Epaillard and Nicolas 
  Kerschenbaum for reporting this.

2011-02-17 Enum4linux v0.8.6

* Added -l option to get long domain name via LDAP.
* Bug fix: Redefining variable warning.

2011-02-12 Enum4linux v0.8.5

* -P attempts to get partial password policy info using
  rpclient's "getdompwinfo" - polenum.py is still much
  better, though.

2008-10-23 Enum4linux v0.8.4

* Bug fix: No longer rejects hostnames containing hyphen.
* Group members output is more parsable.
* Output looks slightly more pretty.
* Help message is more concise.
* -a option is assumed if not other options are used.
* "-K n" option added to keep RID cycling until n 
  consecutive RIDs don't have usernames.

2008-09-16 Enum4linux v0.8.3

* Now tries to get all SIDs for target before RID cycling.
  This should result in local, domain and builtin accounts
  being enumerated - even parent domains sometimes.
* Runs polenum.py (if installed) to get password policy.

2008-03-28 Enum4linux v0.8.2

* Changed HTTP link to point at new labs website.

2007-12-05 Enum4Linux v0.8.1

* nmblookup/nbtstat output now contains human-readable
  descriptions.
* Clearer messages about why RID cycling has failed
  (either can't get SID or RID cycling not allowed).

2007-12-05 Enum4Linux v0.8.0

* Added -a option to try all simple enumeration. You don't
  need to remember long complicated command line options now.
* Gets domain groups and domain group memberships now.
  enum.exe fails to do this sometimes, so this feature is
  actually incompatible with the original. :-)
* Made RID cycling more robust: by default it now tries a list
  of common usernames (administrator, guest, root, ...) to get
  initial SID.
* The "-k username" take a list of usernames to use when
  attempting to get the SID. Previously only supported one.
* -d option implemented. Displays detailed information about
  users (primary group, last logon, password change info, etc.)
  and groups (description, number of members).
* Attempts to get Domain SID to determine if the host is
  in a domain or in a workgroup. Experimental.
* Added -i option to get info about printers.
* During RID cycling, the type of account discovered is
  now displayed (Local User, Domain Group, etc.).
