`bloodyAD` is an Active Directory privilege escalation swiss army knife

## Description

This tool can perform specific LDAP calls to a domain controller in order to perform AD privesc.

`bloodyAD` supports authentication using cleartext passwords, pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket or certificates and binds to LDAP services of a domain controller to perform AD privesc.

Exchange of sensitive information without LDAPS is supported.

It is also designed to be used transparently with a SOCKS proxy.


Simple usage:

```ps1
bloodyAD --host 172.16.1.15 -d bloody.local -u jane.doe -p :70016778cb0524c799ac25b439bd6a31 set password john.doe 'Password123!'
```
